Hello, I'm Le0res the creator of this item set. 

Free for you to use my items, but first some information:

You can use this set with Vanilla water blocks, So first use The Connector item To connect with the vanilla blocks and after use infinitely the Wall item to continue your waterfall. You can drop your waterfall in another vanilla starter waterfall or in a water pool.

All of these items are not collisionable and have 2 sides, so care when you place it, finally you can jump or go trough 

GL and have fun for your mapping
