Installation:

	Open your Documents folder. (accesible from the Start menu)
	Open the folder named Trackmania.
	Open the folder named Items. (this folder contains any items you have installed or made for Trackmania)
	Drag the "Corkscrew" folder from this zip file into the Items folder.
	You should now have a folder in the Items folder names Corkscrew.
	
	If you already have one of the other two Corkscrew sets installed, still drag the "Corkscrew" folder into the Items folder as usual.
	Windows will merge the two folders and the items will be sorted nicely.

	Open the Trackmania editor and go to the items section. You should see this set listed under "Custom".


Quickstart:
	
	Keep opening folders until you reach a set of three items.
	Place the first of the three item down. This will start your corkscrew.
	Select the second item and rotate it until it lines up with the first item. This item is the middle of your corkscrew. You can repeat this step to make the corkscrew longer.
	Line up and place the third item. This will end your corkscrew smoothly and let you transition back to regular blocks.

	To figure out how to use the pack better, read the names of the folders as you look through the pack.


Detailed description of Corkscrew pack:
	
	This description assumed you have all three packs installed. If you don't then the only difference is that you won't have all three of the top level folders. The rest is the same.
	When you open the folder you should see three folders. This corresponds to Roads, Platforms, and Bobsleds.
	Within the Roads folder there is a folder for each type of road, as well as a folder containing the end pieces of each road (i.e. if your road cuts off abruptly this completes the mesh)
	Within any given road's folder you will see two subfolders. The left most folder is a side pivoting corkscrew, the right most folder is a center pivoting corkscrew.
	Within each of these folders you will see 6 folders. These corrospond to a rotation of 45 degrees, 30 degrees, 15 degrees, -45 degrees, -30 degrees and -15 degrees. Positive numbers rotate right, negative numbers rotate left. When you rotate a block in game, each step of that rotation is by 15 degrees. 30 degrees is two rotations, 45 degrees is three rotations.
	Within each of these folders you will see three items. The first item smoothly transitiones into the corkscrew from flat road. The second item is the body of the corkscrew. The third transitions out of the corkscrew. The send item can be repeated to make the corkscrew longer.
	
	Side Pivot:
		The side pivoting corkscrew pivots clockwise around the right side of the road. If you flip the orientation of this piece in the editor the corkscrew will pivot clockwise around the left side of the road. You can change the direction and speed of the rotation using the subfolders.

		If you want to connect a corkscrewed road to one of the default in game blocks then a side pivot is recommended. This is because these blocks use a side pivot when being rotated in free place mode.


	Center Pivot:
		The center pivot rotates around the center of the road. This will lead to a more pure corkscrew than a side pivot, but this will not connect to in game rotated blocks as well as their pivots are around the side of their block. The center pivot corkscrew items should connect to eachother just fine though. So as long as you end the corkscrew on a 0, 90, 180 or 270 degree rotation you should be able to connect everything up just fine and connect back to the default in game blocks.
