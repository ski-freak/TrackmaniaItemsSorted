# TrackmaniaItemsSorted

The complete sorted item pack of all the important custom items fir trackmania mapping, most of which are from item exchange.


This includes almost all the useful route item sets as well as some scenery sets that were relatively generic. Few scenery items have been included as they are usually used for one specific map idea, so if you want them you can get more from [Item Exchange](https://item.mania.exchange) 

If you have a question or problem, there is a 99% chance it can be answered by reading everything here, but if not then you can open an issue or nag me in my [discord](https://discord.gg/sRB54zg) because I rarely check github.

-----------------------------------

## Instructions (AT LEAST READ STEP 2):

1: Download the zip file of the latest release from the releases tab on the right. ([here](https://github.com/That-Ski-Freak/TrackmaniaItemsSorted/releases) is the link for those of you who do not like looking)

2: It is HIGHLY recommended to remove all files from your Documents\Trackmania\Items AND Documents\Trackmania\Blocks and back them up somewhere else on your computer. This is to avoid having duplicate items which can cause issues and frustration.

3: Put the zip file into Documents\Trackmania\Items

4: Right click on the zip file and "extract here".

5: Next time you (re)launch the game you should see the items in the item mode (f3). Tf they are not, you messed something up.

## Using in game, tips, and help:

Most items are in the item mode of the editor and sorted, if you look in the bottom right you can see the folder names as you hover over them. There are 10 main folders which all other folders are in:

* Road Extentions - More basic road shapes.  
* Alt Road - Roads that didn't fit into the first road folder, more unique shapes, and items that aren't really roads themselves but intended to be used with them.  
* Platform Extentions - More basic platform shapes.  
* Alt Platform - Platforms that didn't fit in the other platform folders, partial platforms, platform ramps, etc.  
* Halfbank Platform - Platforms at the road bank/slope.
* Inversions - Wallrides, quartarpipes, etc. The fullspeed blocks.
* Narrow - The narrow platform/road hybrid blocks, as well as teroor's narrow dirt and concrete items.
* Scenery - Numbers, lights, decals for poles, extra supports, road edge lights, + some conventional scenery items.
* Checkpoints - Custom Starts, checkpoints, and finishes.


Block items however I cannot control where they go. The game places them in with the vanilla blocks in block mode (f2). **Most require you to use air mode.**

* **Magnets are in with their normal platform counterparts.**  
* Tm2 ramps are in 1-1-1-1  
* Clip removers are in 1-1-1-4, 1-2-1-1, 1-1-1-4, 2-1-1-4, 3-1-1-4, and 4-1-1-4.  
* There are overhang beam versions of rings in with the other rings at 12-2-1/2  
* The road to platform clips are in 12-6-1  
* Stadium ground transitions are in 13-1-2-3-5/6. The grass remover is located in the same folder at 13-1-2-3-5-2 (you have to click the arrow to see it).

## Random Info

Trackmania sorts the items in the item folder by reverse alphabetical order. That is why many folders have random letters or numbers preceding them, to force a spesific order.


Here are some sets excluded for either cluttering up the editor or being nearly pointless imo, but you may consider downloading yourself and adding them to the USER_ITEMS_HERE folder:  
* [Icy campaign items](https://item.exchange/set/view/11164)  
* [Dirt road conversion](https://item.exchange/set/view/11244)  
* [Grass road conversion](https://item.exchange/set/view/11261)  
* [Plastic road borders](https://item.mania.exchange/set/view/11220)  
* [Tilted platform holes](https://item.exchange/set/view/11065)  
* [Extra bobsled items](https://item.exchange/set/view/10860)  
* [The winter 2021 tmgl items](https://item.exchange/set/view/10616)

### FAQ:  

Q: "Why are the magnets in with the blocks I couldn't find them >:("  
A: The magnets most people used for a long time were created shortly after the game's release and were not well optimized. Doomsday made improved magnets with less file size and a much better experience when using freemode since they are blocks rather than items.  

Q: "Why is Y item(s) not included?"  
A: Either I didn't know it existed (unlikely), they were released recently and I haven't updated yet, they are scenery, or the items were so poorly made I excluded them for that reason.
